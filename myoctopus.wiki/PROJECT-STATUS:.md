- We will launch our maker parts-shop early next year, (when MyOctopus rev.1 will be complete) selling sensors, level shifters and other parts to the maker community. These parts are not restricted to the MyOctopus smart home device, but can be used in many projects. Mid 2016, MyOctopus rev. 2 will be ready, which is when we will launch our crowdfunding campaign. The AppStore and embedded IDE will be available soon after this. By the end of next year, we will have our first complete MyOctopus smart home device ready for the market. During this time, we will continue to build our online communities.

_MyOctopus-OS news:_  

-  Updated Python to ver. [3.4.3](https://github.com/MyOctopus/myoctopus-os/blob/fa9fb5ed9e57556b2e354df18fd94d4fad4de4d3/meta-myoctopus/recipes-python/python/python3-native_3.4.3.bb).
-  Added [i2c-tools](https://github.com/MyOctopus/myoctopus-os/commit/fa9fb5ed9e57556b2e354df18fd94d4fad4de4d3) to the list of required packages (we use a lot of I2C sensors).  

SOME FACTS:  

1. We take 95MB of flash, the official Edison image takes over 450MB

2. Above saving is equivalent of 11 years of temperature data (stored in Celsius)

Petr is implimenting the Cordova system for sensors and Bluetooth; Sylwi is finalizing sensor boards and working on the 3D touchpad mainboard and Peterp is crafting the dashboard for the desktop GUI.  

>We’re working through it. We’ve created the first operational high amperage switch and bundled it with some 
sensors.  We’re now testing and rotating various sensors, converting signals and trying to get most of what’s 
possible from Edison.  In the meantime. the first cut of an UI work and back-end design is ongoing.
