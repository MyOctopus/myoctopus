My software suggestion for first iteration:   
  
Simple web UI for  
1) ON/OFF/SCHEDULE mode  
2) Create/Amend Schedule  
3) Set Required Temperature  
  
Temperatures:  Anti-freeze (cca 9 degrees)/Lukewarm (36)/Warm (50)/Hot (65)/Boiling (85)  
Schedule:      Day of week, time on, time off  
Mode:          On (always keeps the desired temperature), Off (always off), Schedule (based on schedule/temp)  
  
JavaScript app running on NodeJS/nosql db
