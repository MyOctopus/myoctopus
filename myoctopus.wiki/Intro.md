####  What is *MyOctopus?* 
___

######  *So what is MyOctopus, and where did it come from?*  

I'll get to the origin of it later on, for now I'll try to answer the question "what is it"?  
 
Well - some might say it's a light switch, other would say it's an application platform, and I'm sure there will be some that would call it a computing grid, private cloud, home AI, but we prefer to call it a responsive, connected intelligent home system.  
  
Technically speaking, it is a wall mounted device packed with a multitude of sensors, multiple CPU cores, switches, multi protocol device connectivity, 3D interface touchpad and some other features still in development.  But fear not, there are no secrets here and all technical specs will be revealed as we progress with the development.

######  *What it can do*?  
  
  Well - it can run apps.  Apps that can access and parse stored or real-time environmental data from the [sensors](https://github.com/wawrow/myoctopus/wiki/Developer-----Technical-Notes#with-each-myoctopus-device-the-following-components-will-be-available), apps that can perform AI simulations, apps that can utilize the power of parallel, decentralized computing, apps that can enable user control of electical deices, and utilize machine learning to remember important patterns, apps that can integrate with other devices and apps.  It will essentially allow you to run a "system upgrade" on your house (or apartment... or flat... or sub-rented room or half of it ...or the top of a bunk-bed`*`).  

> **We aim to create a development platform that will only be limited by the creativity and imagination of the developers**.

Well, wait a second, you've said grid, you've said app-platform, you've said smart home - *that just doesn't make sense!*  
  
I have to disagree with that - it makes perfect sense.  Think about current solutions for smart homes - you can install a thermostat and make it control the temperature in your home.  You can install a radio controlled switch for the lights in your living room.  You can install air quality sensors that will monitor CO2 levels and warn you in case of danger.  **Are those solutions really smart?**  They are useful, but they will never be much more than a single solution for a given problem.  
  
With *MyOctopus*, you can create a system that, instead of being a solution to a particular problem, is a tool or a platform for problem solving.  We prefer to consider our app platform as a springboard.  The potential of MyOctopus is enormous, any app you wish to create will be possible.  The usefulness and problem-range that it can solve is only limited by the imagination of the people that use it, and the people that will be willing to create applications for it.  I like to think of *MyOctopus* as being a **multitool**, that obviously has a screwdriver, knife, bottle opener and few other tools, but if the circumstances require - it can also become a hammer, coat hanger, sewing machine, toothpick or a comb (well ok - comb is a bit of a stretch for a multitool, though I must say it proves handy if you have dreadlocks ;-) ).  

Another analogy might be a **smartphone** - they are so much more than just a phone. If needs be they can be fitness trackers, navigation devices, entertainment centres, personal music players, virtual assistants and so much more. *MyOctopus* brings the same smartness to your home as a smartphone did to your Nokia 3310.

`* Lower level bunk-beds might also be upgradable, we're still discussing that matter ;-)
