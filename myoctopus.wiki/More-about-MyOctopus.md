####Is it a Smart Home? Is it a Cloud? Is it a Super Computer? It’s more than that!

_My Octopus_ is an open Smart Home Platform that will not only allow your house to be intelligent but also will provide an application platform hosted right in your home, in your light switches and sensors. Potential applications and uses are only limited by the imagination of the community of software developers – not really a limitation is it?

Each “octopus” is a self-sustained node of your private cloud that adds “smartness” to your home. It can be built slowly with very low upfront cost, and can be configured in a matter of minutes with very little DIY work, through your smart phone.  You can use it to control your lights, heating, house-ware, door locks; - essentially any electronic device that can be switched on and off, controlled electronically or through software in any way.  
  

_My Octopus_ can become what you want it to be, from a simple mobile controlled dimmer to a full AI-driven intelligent home that will make sure that you always have warm water when you need it. and will switch off all the lights when you leave for holidays.  It can also be your security system that will inform you if there is suspicious activity while you’re away.  
  

On the other hand it can also become your computing platform, using spare CPU time to search for alien radio signals, host your website, speed up video encoding, mine crypto-currency, or become your NAS server that will keep your files nicely replicated across your home infrastructure, so even in the case of multiple hardware failures they will stay available.  All of this is accomplished thanks to this unique architecture, which has never been applied in a smart home solution before now.
