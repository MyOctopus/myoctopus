 — Created his first cloud computing platform as MSc dissertation project.  Since then he works on parallel trade processing systems that can run through millions of trades in the blink of an eye.  At night he turns 
into an additive manufacturing superhero providing 3D printing consultations and helping all makers by running www.filamentshop.ie.

 — Our electronics guru.  His thoughts are more like electron beams that turn into complex circuits as 
he use his lightsabre-iron and force forged solder in the low voltage lands.

 — With the calmness of a Tibetan monk, he puts together lines of JavaScript code that connect users 
with the digital world of the web.  As his alter ego he designs data warehouses proving that there is no Big Data big enough.
