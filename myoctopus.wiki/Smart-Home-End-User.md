####You might ask: *“Why should I choose My Octopus over other solutions?”*  
 
Well, here are a few reasons:  

-    If you buy an other brand smart switch it’ll probably be a switch till' the end of its days, it might be 
smart, but it is nonetheless a switch. If you use a MyOctopus switch, you can make it into so much more (see Applications below).  


-    MyOctopus can be used as non-touch switch. It creates 3D field around it so it can recognize gestures even if you wear gloves! 
  
-    Adding new functions to your system is as easy as installing apps from the app store.  
  
  
-    Installation is as simple as replacing the old switch with a new one, no need to buy a base station, no need to run new cables, no need for any significant upfront investment, design or any other major decision. Just pick the application you want to run, get the hardware and run it.  

-    Configuration takes only few minutes. Once the switch is powered, all you need to do is detect it through the mobile app, and give it a nice name (requires bluetooth). It will immediately connect to your existing network through your home current wifi infrastructure.  

-    If you don’t want to invest a lot, you can start with one switch only.  There are still a multitude of things you can do with it.  You can add as many devices as you want (limited only by your Wifi's capacity).  
  
  **The more you add the higher the “IQ”  of your house will be.**
